# KeeleSepp Project State

Repository: `zakutailopavel-cyber/keelesepp`
Verified main: `6a31ecd8c86c3e729e1a24a455a42b0151fd8a77` — merged #96, project-state reconciliation after #95
Current documentation branch: `agent/reconcile-functions-rollout`

## Current objective

Record the ACCEPTED first real curriculum production teaching loop and hand off to Lesson Builder v1 — Normalized Activity Contract.

The merged path is:

`real curriculum -> Teacher Home -> est-b1-school-learning-01 -> adaptive Lesson Mode -> evidence/handoff -> Learning Profile / Teacher Home`.

PR #94 switched Teacher Home to the real curriculum source. PR #95 then bound the first real school curriculum lesson (`est-b1-01:0`) to its own trusted adaptive lesson blueprint. PR #96 reconciled repository state after #95.

## Verified repository state

Current remote `main` is `6a31ecd8c86c3e729e1a24a455a42b0151fd8a77`.

Merged on current `main`:

- #94 `fix(learning): use real curriculum in Teacher Home`;
- #95 `Real Curriculum Lesson Mode v1: school lesson to evidence and handoff`;
- #96 `docs: reconcile project state after PR 95 merge`.

Independent open PRs remain separate and must not be mixed into the learning rollout:

- #83 adaptive lesson desktop density — old draft;
- #78 reliability spinner retry state — old draft;
- #74 Google Calendar sync reliability — open;
- #72 Frappe/ERPNext spike — finance staging;
- #71 finance staging stabilization — open.

Current GitHub `main` is authoritative. This reconciliation changes documentation only.

## Real Curriculum Lesson Mode v1

The merged school slice keeps the contracts established in #95:

- exact curriculum/blueprint identity through `functions/curriculum-lesson-bindings.js`;
- stable blueprint `est-b1-school-learning-01` for curriculum lesson key `est-b1-01:0`;
- independent Vocabulary / Grammar / Speaking Support-Core-Advanced routes;
- answer-safe diagnostic and final assessment;
- roleplay and changed transfer context;
- append-only session/evidence persistence through trusted Functions;
- optional `curriculumLessonKey` on new school sessions/evidence;
- resume restores exact word marks and route state;
- blank scores remain absent rather than becoming zero;
- completion creates a handoff but does not rewrite `students.skillMap` or grant curriculum mastery/credit.

Main implementation boundaries remain:

- `functions/curriculum-lesson-bindings.js`;
- `adaptive-lessons/est-b1-school-learning.js`;
- `teacher-home-core.js` and `haldus-teacher-home/index.html`;
- `haldus-adaptive-lesson/index.html` and `lesson-workspace-core.js`;
- `learning-session-store.js` and `functions/learning-session-api.js`;
- `functions/learning-profile-evidence-api.js` and `haldus-learning-profile/index.html`;
- `real-curriculum-lesson.test.js` plus related Teacher Home/Profile/API/emulator coverage;
- `docs/REAL_CURRICULUM_LESSON_MODE_V1.md` and `docs/ADAPTIVE_LESSON_SYSTEM.md`.

## Verification

Verified from PR #95 / its reviewed head:

- CI-selected CRM/learning suite: **223/223 passed**;
- Functions unit tests: **157/157 passed**;
- Auth/Firestore/Functions emulator integration: **25/25 passed**;
- final Teacher Home/curriculum checks: **14/14 passed**;
- local browser smoke covered lesson identity, independent routes, transfer, hidden assessment answers, blank-score summary and Preview handoff behavior.

Known extended-glob noise from #95 remains unchanged: three stale `adaptive-lesson-ui.test.js` assertions reproduce on unchanged main, and one isolated-worktree test required missing `crm-v2/node_modules/jsdom`. These were not represented as passing.

## Production state

Vercel production for current `main` `6a31ecd8...` is verified **READY**. The active production deployment is `dpl_FBbT2oSExETZnA45S7u6rKEM3wYS` from the primary GitHub-connected `keelesepp` project.

Authenticated production source downloads verified both Functions against main after the
2026-09-06 recovery of a stale-source redeployment:

- `learningSessionApi`: version **6**, ACTIVE, updated `2026-09-06T08:11:42.471Z`;
- `learningProfileEvidenceApi`: version **5**, ACTIVE, updated `2026-09-06T08:11:45.569Z`;
- build: `0d26d420-7f52-4672-badb-9434ce0e7e21`;
- source hash: `c208808a2d80bfe88674c62a7f86d2a4c24e113a`.

Both deployed handlers match main byte-for-byte. That separately authorized selective deployment
is complete; it grants no permission for further Firebase deployment. No new deployment was
performed for this acceptance documentation.

## Production teaching acceptance — ACCEPTED

On 2026-09-06 the owner confirmed that the recorded results belong to a genuine Robert lesson
and accepted the main production teaching loop. Read-only production verification found:

- completed session: `kJkHMe21CzXUqpN5NgrA`;
- status: `completed`; completedAt: `2026-09-06T08:43:12.101Z`;
- curriculumLessonKey: `est-b1-01:0`; lessonBlueprintId: `est-b1-school-learning-01`;
- 14 persisted `teacher_judgement` events and 3 `summary_score` events (17 total);
- summary scores: Vocabulary **50**, Grammar **74**, Speaking **70**;
- persisted routeBySkill: vocabulary **advanced**, grammar **advanced**, speaking **advanced**;
- explicit handoff and teacher note `Väga` persisted;
- the same scored handoff is visible in Learning Profile and Robert's Teacher Home card;
- `learningSessionApi` and `learningProfileEvidenceApi` returned HTTP **200**;
- no Functions errors were found in inspected flow logs;
- the full student document, including `students.skillMap`, is unchanged against the pre-smoke snapshot;
- lesson journal and `curriculumProgressEvents` remain unchanged; no automatic mastery, credit
  or advancement to lesson 2 was created.

Earlier session `dDF13J9b4k4ME3oe01h2` is a separate completed technical attempt with one judgement
and an unscored handoff. It was not reset, overwritten or confused with the genuine scored session.
Active-session refresh/resume and navigation persistence were verified before completion.
The audit did not create synthetic judgements, evidence, handoffs or credit.

### Non-blocking follow-up — NOT OBSERVED

**Production vocabulary_mark interaction not yet observed in a genuine lesson; verify opportunistically during the next real lesson.**

No `vocabulary_mark` event exists in this genuine session. It is unknown whether the word-mark
operation was actually performed; data loss is not established. The current contract supports
word marks and automated tests cover them. This production interaction is **NOT OBSERVED**,
not PASS or FAIL, and the owner explicitly accepted it as a non-blocking follow-up.

The first real curriculum production teaching loop is **ACCEPTED**. This rollout no longer
blocks Lesson Builder. No Firebase or Vercel deployment is needed for this documentation update.

## Lesson Builder boundary

Lesson Builder / Content Engine normalization is no longer blocked by this rollout.

The next planned workstream is `Lesson Builder v1 — Normalized Activity Contract`: stable activity IDs first, with future-compatible fields for response modes (including voice), assets/visuals, progression rules and collaboration/debate, without implementing all feature families in one PR.

## Current documentation work

Branch: `agent/reconcile-functions-rollout`.

Changed files:

- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`;
- `docs/REAL_CURRICULUM_LESSON_MODE_V1.md`.

Purpose: record verified production teaching acceptance and its non-blocking vocabulary-mark follow-up in existing draft PR #97. No new PR or merge. Historical automated test results above were not rerun for this documentation-only change; documentation diff and acceptance consistency were checked.

No application code, Firebase configuration, data, rules or production services are changed by this documentation branch.

## Next safe step

Lesson Builder v1 — Normalized Activity Contract.
Start it as a separate bounded workstream after this documentation update; do not implement it
inside PR #97. Verify the non-blocking vocabulary-mark interaction during the next real lesson.
